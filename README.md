# App - Bending of Brittle-Matrix-Composite Beams

## Description
A web app for an interactive deflection calculation of a composite beam to predict the ultimate and
serviceability limit states, considering the deflection limit.

## Launch app
Start the app in standard Jupyter Notebook mode →

(By clicking on the links, the application will be launched in few minutes using "mybinder" service associated with the github repository)

## App backend dependencies
This app depends on the following open-source packages from the [BMCS Group](https://github.com/bmcs-group):
* [bmcs_cross_section](https://pypi.org/project/bmcs-cross-section): for calculating moment-curvature behaviour of a cross-section.
* [bmcs_beam](https://pypi.org/project/bmcs-beam): for calculating the load-deflection response of a beam.
* [bmcs_utils](https://pypi.org/project/bmcs-utils): graphical user interface support using Jupyter widgets.
